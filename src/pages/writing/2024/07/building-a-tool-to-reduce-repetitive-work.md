## Introduction


## The problem

I used to regularly walk with a Rambler's walking group named West Midlands Walking Group (aka. WMWG). After walking with them for several months, I decided I would contribute something back (it's ran by volunteers) and help them advertise walks online.

One of my responsibilities involved posting walks to [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com) 4 times a year, the process for this looked something like the following:
- Go to the [WMWG website](https://www.wmwg.org.uk)
- Go to the walks section
- For each walk on the list...
  - Copy the walk name into the title field on Meetup
  - Copy the description/additional notes into a description field on Meetup, tweaking various bits depending on the content (for example, if the description mentioned parking, copy that information into the parking section)
  - Set the start/end date/time
  - Copy the postcode and post it into the postcode field and position the map pin on Google Maps.
  - Click the "Email walk contact" link and copy that link into the contact field
  - Click the "Google Directions" link and copy that link into the Google Maps link field
  - ...lots more manual stuff

To boil it down, it was a lot of manual, repetitive work that I found more and more tedious each time I had to do it. I found myself double-checking everything to make sure I'd copied it properly and made quite a lot of mistakes. In total it probably took around 2-3 hours each time I had to do it.
